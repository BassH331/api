Sanitized placeholder for the original `main.py`.

The original file contained hard-coded credentials which have been removed for security.
Use the FastAPI server in `api/index.py` and set the required environment variables for credentials:

- ISDA_USERNAME
- ISDA_PASSWORD
- ISDA_BASE_URL (optional)

For local development copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values.
